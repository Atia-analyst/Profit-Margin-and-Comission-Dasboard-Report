Interactive Profit Margin and Commission Dashboard for Business Analysis

**Business Problem:**
We need to create a commission dashboard for directors that calculates commissions for new contracts while **ensuring profit margins are maintained.** The challenge is to reward performance appropriately without impacting profitability.

**Methdology:**

**1. ****KPI Definition:** Identify measurable performance indicators (e.g., service delivery (Fill Rate %), Confirmation Time in 24 Hours, Same day Requests Filled within 1 Hour, Gross Profit Margin %).

**2. ****Profit Margin Targeting:** Calculate **expected profit margins** for the new contract after accounting for additional costs. Set a **minimum threshold margin ** that must be achieved for commission eligibility.

**3. ****Commission Design:** Link director commission to KPI achievement and profit margin attainment. Apply deductions if performance falls below target **(penalty mechanism aligns with marginal incentive theory)**.

**4. ****Monitoring & Feedback:** Track KPIs and profit margins periodically.

**5.** **Optimization:** Use a cost-benefit approach to assess trade-offs between additional hires, service quality, and profit maximization.
**Results:**
