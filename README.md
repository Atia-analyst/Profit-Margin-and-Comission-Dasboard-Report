Interactive Profit Margin and Commission Dashboard for Business Analysis

**Business Problem:**
We need to create a commission dashboard for directors that calculates commissions for new contracts while **ensuring profit margins are maintained.** The challenge is to reward performance appropriately without impacting profitability.

**Methdology:**

**1.**KPI Definition:** Identify measurable performance indicators (e.g., service delivery (Fill Rate %), Confirmation Time in 24 Hours, Same day Requests Filled within 1 Hour, Gross Profit Margin %).

**2.**Profit Margin Targeting:** Calculate **expected profit margins** for the new contract after accounting for additional costs. Set a **minimum threshold margin ** that must be achieved for commission eligibility.

**3.**Commission Design:** Link director commission to KPI achievement and profit margin attainment. Apply deductions if performance falls below target **(penalty mechanism aligns with marginal incentive theory)**.

**4.**Monitoring & Feedback:** Track KPIs and profit margins periodically.

**5.** **Optimization:** Use a cost-benefit approach to assess trade-offs between additional hires, service quality, and profit maximization.

**Results:**

**Recommendation:**

**The Success:** Mention that the GP Margin (11.32%) is excellent, meaning the business is profitable on the work it does complete.

**The Solution:** **The strategy wasn't to change the pricing**, but to fix the **Operational Velocity.** By focusing on "Confirmation Time" and "Same-day Requests," you are effectively turning the "Total Balance" from a negative value to a positive one.
